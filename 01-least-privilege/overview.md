## 🔍 Objective

Practice applying RBAC and least privilege

The objective of this lab is to demostrate the principle of least privilege by creating and managing user accounts with restricted permissions, verifying that users can only perform actions with their assigned roles. This lab reinforces secure access control practices by limiting unnecessary privliges, reducing attack surface, and ensuring that system resources are accessed only by authorized users.
