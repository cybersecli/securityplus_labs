## 🔍 Objective

The objective of this lab is to perform a basic network scan using NMAP to identify active hosts, detect open ports, and determine running services on a target sytem within a local network. This lab demonstrates foundational skills in reconnaissance, service enumeration, and understanding how attackers amd defenders use network scanning to assess system exposure.



## 🛠️ Steps Taken

Step 1. Identified local host information
  1a. Used ipconfig to fetermine the machines IPv4 address (192.168.1.82) to use as the scan target
  
Step 2.
